Theme is going to be cartoons

We're going to do all of the heading stuff linking to our js css jquery
and bootstrap (maybe). Not getting to visually fancy.

Skeleton html.

Gotta get some buttons rolling with some cartoon action.

Get a search bar going.

All the cartoons are going to be in an array. When you search the new cartoon
the array will be appended with the new cartoon with the submit button.

From here we will need our ajax call to giphy api. Will also call with added buttons.
  Do we do this with a loop or are we doing something else? tbd

When the api is called we should have the 10 gifs pop us as still images.

When clicked those images will move. Click again to stop.

Get the ratings to show.
